# Lq-group-screening
Robust group variable screening based on maximum Lq-likelihood estimation

Each simulation scenario can be conducted according to this R code.

The r code includes three main functions.
MLqE.est: The iterative algorithm for MLqE of coefficients of regression using each group of variables.
blosc.MLqE: Group screening of LqG.
blosc.marg.MLqE: Group screening of Lg1.
